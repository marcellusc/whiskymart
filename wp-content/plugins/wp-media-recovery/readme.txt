A tool that helps you recover older and existing images from your `/wp-content/uploads` folder after the database is reset.

## Description

A tool that helps you recover older and existing images from your `/wp-content/uploads` folder after the database is reset.

When you delete an image or any media file from your library, it will only remove it from the database.

However, you might decide to use this media again, and instead of uploading it and using up your server storage with Media Library Recovery, you can restore the existing media from the uploads directory and re-insert it into the WordPress database.

### Usage

This tool **DOES NOT re-upload any media on the server**, and it will only scan the existing media folders and display all the media.

Then you will have the ability to individually select the media files you want to recover or use the filters to speed up the process.

_Be aware if you choose to recover any existing media, it will create a duplicate one._

### Features

- Recover and restore media deleted from the database but still available on the server.
- Filter recoverable and existing media.
- Recover up to 10 images at a time.
